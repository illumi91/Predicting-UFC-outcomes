## Introduction

For this project I will be acting as a consultant for a bet site firm and we will be dealing with a classification problem. 

In particular, have been asked to predict who is going to win a potential fight.

Our goal is to create a Machine Learning Model such that we can get some valuable predictions for our company.

We will be working with UFC data containing information about fights from 1993 up till today.

We'll be following the OSEMN methodology:

1.Obtain
